### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



**My name is Asrar | Ø£Ø³Ø±Ø§Ø± âœ¨**


Who am I? :eyes:

As a formal way:  A fresh graduate from Computer Science major with great programming skills. 

Informally: A person motivated by curiosity, thirst for knowledge, and enthusiasm to try new things. 

I spend a lot of my free time reading philosophy, psychology, life experiences, and technology. I found reading is a way to learn and benefit from peoples' experiences, give me a new perspective on things, and explore new ideas. Haruki Murakami is one of my favorite authors, and his novels are a masterpiece that makes you believe as if the events described could actually happen.:crystal_ball:  
Also, I love [Mana](https://mana.net/) and [Thmanyah](https://thmanyah.com/) articles.   


Here are some ideas to get you started:
